                    Tapp is a customer care application for a Malaysian operator Digi.
                    The app utilizes the Clean Swift architecture.
                    I was the only developer on this project, and I've built the app completely from scratch.
                    This app has interesting features, such as OCR which can scan a specific Tapp voucher used to
                    top up user's balance, and it can also scan a Malaysian ID card to get the user's details needed
                    for registration.

                    I've contributed to the development of Aura Home app,
                    which uses wireless radio frequency (RF) signals to
                    detect motion inside the home environment, allowing
                    subscribed users to receive real-time motion event push
                    notifications. This app also monitors the user’s
                    location. Specifically, it monitors a particular area
                    defined by the user i.e., their home address, and
                    notifies them once they enter or leave that area. I've
                    worked on implementing in-app-purchases, geofence, and
                    push notifications.

                    Smart Birth Control System
                </h3>
                <p class="project-post-meta">
                    I've helped develop an app for birth control pills,
                    which uses custom-made hardware, called Cadence case, by
                    implementing the BLE communication functionality into
                    it. This app communicates with the Cadence case in order
                    to keep track of when the user has: opened the case,
                    taken the pill, closed the case, etc. By using data
                    received from the hardware, the app does various
                    calculations to determine whether the user is taking the
                    pills properly or is at risk of getting pregnant. If the
                    latter is true, the app suggests starting a new pack at
                    a different time, and so on. User’s data history is
                    stored both online and offline by using Firestore.
