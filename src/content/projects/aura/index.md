I've contributed to the development of Aura Home app, which uses wireless radio frequency (RF) signals to detect motion inside the home environment, allowing subscribed users to receive real-time motion event push notifications. This app also monitors the user’s location. Specifically, it monitors a particular area defined by the user i.e., their home address, and notifies them once they enter or leave that area. I've worked on implementing in-app-purchases, geofence, and push notifications.
