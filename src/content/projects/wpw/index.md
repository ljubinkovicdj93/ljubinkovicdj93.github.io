As its name suggests, this app lets you easily discover what gear belongs to which professional baseball player. Not only that, but the user is also able to order these items. Each gear piece has detailed info, including links to buy the gear. There are a lot of options provided to the user, such as: keeping the favorite gear in one place, filtering by various criteria, thus very easy to browse/shop, commenting, tagging, sharing, liking, etc... You can think of this app as Pinterest for baseball players.
