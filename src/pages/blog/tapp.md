Tapp is a customer care application for a Malaysian operator Digi. The app utilizes the Clean Swift architecture. I was the only developer on this project, and I’ve built the app completely from scratch. This app has interesting features, such as OCR which can scan a specific Tapp voucher used to top up user’s balance, and it can also scan a Malaysian ID card to get the user’s details needed for registration.
