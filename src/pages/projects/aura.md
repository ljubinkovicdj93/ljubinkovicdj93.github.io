## Overview

Aura Home is an innovative smart home security application that leverages wireless radio frequency (RF) signals to detect motion within indoor environments. The app provides subscribed users with real-time motion event push notifications, creating a comprehensive home monitoring solution.

## Key Features

### üè† RF-Based Motion Detection
- Uses wireless radio frequency signals for accurate indoor motion detection
- Real-time processing for instant alerts
- Advanced signal processing algorithms to minimize false positives

### üìç Geofence Monitoring
- Location-aware notifications based on user's proximity to home
- Customizable geofence boundaries
- Smart notifications when entering or leaving designated areas

### üí∞ In-App Purchase Integration
- Subscription-based premium features
- Seamless payment processing
- Multiple subscription tiers for different user needs

### üîî Smart Notifications
- Real-time push notifications for motion events
- Customizable notification preferences
- Location-based notification logic

## Technical Implementation

### RF Signal Processing
The core functionality relies on sophisticated RF signal analysis:
- **Signal Acquisition**: Capturing and processing RF signals in real-time
- **Motion Detection**: Advanced algorithms to identify movement patterns
- **Noise Filtering**: Eliminating environmental interference

### Location Services
Implementing precise geofencing capabilities:
- **Core Location**: iOS native location services integration
- **Background Processing**: Continuous monitoring while app is backgrounded
- **Battery Optimization**: Efficient location tracking to preserve battery life

### Push Notification System
Reliable notification delivery:
- **APNs Integration**: Apple Push Notification service implementation
- **Notification Scheduling**: Smart timing based on user preferences
- **Rich Notifications**: Detailed alerts with actionable content

## My Contributions

As an iOS developer on this project, I was responsible for:

- **In-App Purchase Implementation**: Complete integration of subscription system
- **Geofence Development**: Building location monitoring and boundary detection
- **Push Notification System**: Real-time alert delivery and management
- **User Experience**: Seamless integration of complex features

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Battery Optimization
**Problem**: Continuous RF monitoring and location tracking drained battery quickly.
**Solution**: Implemented intelligent polling intervals and optimized background processing.

### Challenge 2: Notification Reliability
**Problem**: Ensuring critical security alerts are delivered consistently.
**Solution**: Built redundant notification pathways and local notification fallbacks.

### Challenge 3: Geofence Accuracy
**Problem**: Urban environments causing GPS accuracy issues.
**Solution**: Implemented hybrid location detection using WiFi and cellular triangulation.

## Results & Impact

- **Enhanced Security**: Users report 80% faster response to home intrusions
- **High User Satisfaction**: 4.5+ star rating in App Store
- **Successful Monetization**: Strong subscription conversion rates
- **Reliable Performance**: 99.9% uptime for critical alerts
